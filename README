I got lazy with setting up a new Linux workstation everytime I provision a new VM. So instead, Ansible will do this work for me.

========================
Working Operating System
========================
RHEL-based OS

==========
Directory
==========
roles:
	file_editor - (Default VIM)
	terminal - BASH related tasks
	version_control - (Default GIT)
headless.yml - Skeleton environment #TODO
full.yml - Fully functional workstation

==========
Directions: 
==========
Install Ansible via your Operating System package manager (ie. yum, dnf, apt-get)

Run commands:
cd playbooks/
ansible-playbook -K site.yml
